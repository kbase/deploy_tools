Wish List:
- Allow IP addresses instead of hostnames
- Flesh out boot strap option
- Add "local" directory for private/local data (i.e. ssl files, host files, etc)

for ci-:
- add DNS entries for ci.kbase.us, narrative-ci.kbase.us
- add public interfaces for ci.kbase, narrative-ci
- update hosts files
- loop over mongo connection in setup_mongo, keep trying till works (or takes too long)
- add needed packages to master image (or at least to nodes post-create)
== (narrative needs libssl-dev)
-- apt-get install -y bzr cvs libcurl4-gnutls-dev mysql-client libgd2-noxpm libssl-dev
- automate adding ufw rules to -www
- redirect rule to send ci.kbase.us to narrative-ci
- automate creating my.cnf file (in particular bind-address)
- automate putting handlemanager on same host as workspace
- how is hsi db being created?  (need to get hsi.sql file from github repo)
- need to bootstrap ws? (from readme.md: Run administration/initialize.py and follow the instructions; also add types)
- bootstrap shock: create dirs (create separate vol?)
- add port to shock.cfg file
- disable apache
- bootstrapping for invocation svc (one-off: ran setup_service on node)
- autodeploy tools have git.kbase.us hardcoded for all clones (using clonetag; not ported back to install)

- figure out ci-narrative bootstrap
-- install docker (+ update kernel if ubuntu 12.04) (see Readme-deployment.md)
-- run install.sh script?
-- mkdir -p /kb/deployment/services/narrative/docker/ (?)
-- after docker install, deploy_cluster should be ok
-- install nginx-extras and configure
--- lua_package_path
-- ssl certs
-- need extra nameserver in resolv.conf? (narrative-next configured this way)
-- stop and start proxy logger

- change cluster.ini to deployment.cfg
- workspace still requires a special step
- Add something for external network interface to config file 
- merge back setup scripts into deploy_cluster

for invocation:
- communities_api needs kbrest_common scripts deployed to dev_container
- communities_api needs communities svc deployed first (generates docs from there)
- still some services which do not successfully deploy under invocation (see setup_invocation)
- workspace_service does not honor deploy-client target

Completed
- remove need to specify config file and 'global'
- change shock and awe config files to be generated from ini file
- Add ability to tag current head and insert tag into cluster.ini file
- add mysql-client to base (added to bootstrape_node which is still evolving)
- Split up deploy_service for the git checkout portion and the build step
- Add no-op option

complete for ci-:
- figure out mongo auth config so setup_mongo works
